# Shoulder-Implant-X-Ray-Image-Classification-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network-CNN

● In the project, we aimed to classify shoulder implant manufacturers using X-ray image data collected from various sources. These images represented four manufacturers, resulting in a 4-class classification problem.
● We utilized data augmentation techniques to enhance the dataset.
● We employed a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture and experimented with various pretrained models, including VGG16, ResNet152, DenseNet201, X-Net, InceptionV3, and vision transformers.
